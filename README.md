# Chicago_Taxi_Data_Analysis
This project uses machine learning on the Chicago Taxi Trip dataset to predict trip durations. Using Python and scikit-learn, it analyzes data, engineers features, and builds predictive models.

Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the Chicago Taxi Trip dataset to predict taxi trip duration using machine learning models.

Data

The dataset contains taxi trip records for rides in Chicago. Each record has attributes like pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, trip miles, fare, payment type and additional metadata.

Methods

The project utilizes Python and scikit-learn for data analysis, feature engineering and modeling. The key steps are:

Data Loading and Cleaning

Load the CSV data into a Pandas Data Frame.

Handle missing values, data types and outliers.

Add derived features like hour, day from timestamps.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualize trip locations, temporal patterns, numeric distributions.

Identify correlations between features.

Feature Engineering

Engineer features like trip speed, time of day, payment types.

Map pickup and dropoff locations to communities.

Modeling

Compare regression models like Random Forest, Linear Regression.

Use metrics like MAE, MSE, R-squared, RMSE for evaluation.

Expected Outcomes

Predictive model for trip duration with good performance.

Interpretable insights into key factors affecting duration.

Suggestions to optimize taxi trip times.

This covers the key elements of my updated proposed approach. This approach is subject to change based on any issues encountered during the implementation phase which may lead changes in it in terms of its proposed milestones including but not limited to specific methods, visualizations, and algorithms as needed.
