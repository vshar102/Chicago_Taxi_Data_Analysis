# Chicago_Taxi_Data_Analysis

🎯 Project Overview

Developed predictive analytics solution for transportation optimization, analyzing comprehensive taxi operations data to improve fleet management, route optimization, and service delivery efficiency in urban transportation networks.

💼 Business Problem

Transportation companies needed better trip duration prediction capabilities and operational insights to optimize fleet allocation, improve customer experience, reduce empty miles, and enhance operational efficiency in competitive urban taxi markets.

🔧 Technical Solution

Built predictive models to estimate taxi trip duration using comprehensive features including Trip Miles, Tips, Dropoff and Pickup Community Areas, timestamps, fare data, and payment types. Performed extensive data preprocessing with missing value handling, outlier treatment, feature engineering (trip speed, time of day patterns, community mapping), and feature scaling. Implemented Random Forest and Linear Regression models with comprehensive evaluation using MAE, MSE, R-squared, and RMSE metrics.

📊 Key Results

Comprehensive predictive modeling framework for trip duration estimation
Advanced feature engineering including temporal patterns and location mapping
Extensive model evaluation across multiple performance metrics
Insights into key factors affecting trip duration and operational efficiency

💰 Business Impact

Identified opportunities for fleet optimization, dynamic pricing strategies, and demand forecasting applications. Provided foundation for improved resource allocation, route optimization, and enhanced customer service delivery in transportation industry, enabling data-driven operational improvements and competitive advantage.
